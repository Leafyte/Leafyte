👋 Hi, I'm Karthik M

I'm a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) undergraduate with a strong interest in
software development, embedded systems, and artificial intelligence.

I enjoy building practical projects that combine programming with real-world problem
solving — from web applications to Arduino-based systems.

🔹 Currently learning:
- Python, Java, and Web Development
- Embedded Systems using Arduino
- Basics of Machine Learning and Computer Vision
- Linux, Git, and developer tools

🔹 Interests:
- Full Stack Web Development
- Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers
- Artificial Intelligence & Robotics
- Open-source and continuous learning

🔹 Goals:
- Build impactful projects during my engineering journey
- Strengthen core CS fundamentals
- Work towards advanced AI/robotics systems in the future

I believe in learning by building, experimenting, and improving every day.
